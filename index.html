			<p> When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits, I dreamed of changing the world. </p>
			<p> As I grew older and wiser, I discovered the world would not change, so I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country. But it, too, seemed immovable. </p>
			<p> As I grew into my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt, I settled for changing only my family, those closest to me, but alas, they would have none of it. </p>
			<p> And now, as I lie on my death bed, I suddenly realize: </p>
			<p> If I had only changed myself first, then by example I would have changed my family. From their inspiration and encouragement, I would then have been able to better my country, and who knows, I may have even changed the world. </p>
